# phonon_polarization
Calculate phonon circular polarization and magnetic moments from Abinit output.

This MATLAB script uses a netCDF output file from the Abinit post-processing executable anaddb to calculate phonon circular polarizations and magnetic moments using the Born effective charges. The input parameters are set up for the case of quartz (see https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2302.03925 for details and https://doi.org/10.16907/7b8bd7d7-d897-4ff6-9cf4-e8335a6e413 for data).
